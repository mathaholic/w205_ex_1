hospital_variability.txt

Compared to the first two questions, this question had very little coding, but required quite a bit of critical thinking.  One of the first things I noticed was that a 0 to 100 scale measure (AMI_7A) had a statistical variance of over 500.  This struck me as odd, so I reviewed the raw data. I found that in all but 3 hospitals, this measure score was not provided.  This, the sparsity of data was causing the variance to be all over the place and was not being normalized by a higher aggregate like state or hospital.  I decided to set a threshold for measures that could be considered for variance, as data sparsity cannot give me a good predictor.  I set the threshold to be 3000, as we had 4500 hospitals.  It did not seem fair to judge a procedure when only a handful of hospitals ever performed it.  It seemed to make more sense to judge a procedure that was practiced at the majority of hospitals.  After using this qualifier in the WHERE clause, my variability results seemed more realistic.  I also added WHERE score is not NULL as a filter too; as I was reading some documentation that said statistical functions in Hive can be unpredictable when NULL values are included in analysis.  Since my first experiment with RANK() OVER() went well, I used it in favor of a percentile for this analysis.  My results were as expected, time results more often than proportion results.  This makes sense to me, as a proportion can only vary over 100 points, but a time measure can vary over hours or even days.
