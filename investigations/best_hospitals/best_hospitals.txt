To answer this question, I first evaluated the effective_care_t table.  This is the transformed version of the Timely and Effective Care - Hospitals csv.  I discovered that some of the measures had non-numeric scores, such as Emergency room volume.  Since this measure had no scores, I did not see how it could be quantified so it was not included in the analysis.  I also realized that some scores were times, and some were proportions.  In addition, in reading the documentation, I realized that for some scores, the lower the better, and for others, the higher the better.  So, I created a supplementary table called measure_supp that contained the measure ids and a column I called qualifier that had either "B" for basketball (higher scores are better in basketball) or "G" for golf (lower scores are better in golf) or NULL for non numeric scores like the Emergency Room Volumes.  

I then joined the effective care table to the supplementary table with the intent of separating out the two different classifications of measures.  Once I got each hospital's B and G scores, I ranked them manually using percentiles.  Any hospital that had both a B score above the 75th percentile AND a G score below the 25th percentile was considered the best of the best hospitals by my code. It was very important to have both classifications of scores meet these thresholds, as I found that the top hospital with the top B score only had 37 beds when I checked with and outside source, and was only for knee and hip surgeries.  I got back something like 35 hospitals when I considered both scores, so I then combined the scores and brought back the top ten results.  In addition,  I pulled in the variance and average to the final table.  When I checked these hospitals against US News and World Report, I found that they were consistently listed above average.
